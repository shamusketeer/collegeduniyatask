##College Table App

This is a React application that displays a table of colleges along with their details. Users can search for colleges by name, sort the table based on different attributes, and view more colleges as they scroll down the page.

*Features
  **1. Search Functionality:** Users can search for colleges by their names. As they type in the search input field, the table updates dynamically to show matching colleges.

  **2. Sorting:** Users can sort the table based on different attributes such as college ID, name, rating, fees, and user review rating. Clicking on the table header for each attribute sorts the table in ascending order. Clicking again reverses the order.

  **3. Infinite Scrolling:** As the user scrolls down the page, more colleges are dynamically loaded and added to the table, making it convenient to explore a large list of colleges without overwhelming the user with all the data at once.

**How to Use:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run npm install to install the project dependencies.
4. Run npm start to start the development server.
5. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.
6. Project Structure:

**src/**
CollegeTable.js: The main component that renders the college table.
App.js: The root component that renders the CollegeTable component.
index.js: Entry point of the application.

**Technologies Used:**

1. React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. useState and useEffect hooks: React hooks used for managing state and side effects, respectively.
